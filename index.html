        <p>If there are, we all be dead. Well, I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are
            actually quite lovely. And YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back
            to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland? No, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry'
            Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal
            the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen. You seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you.
            Naturally... but I find that Thibault cancels out Capa Ferro. Don't you?
        </p>

        <p>You have a great gift for rhyme. Well, is only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right... over too
            quickly. I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?
            You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned!
            Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get
            involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian
            when death is on the line"! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...
        </p>

        <p>Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*. Don't worry, I won't let it go to my head. It's possible.
            I kill a lot of people. Oh, the sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern. I will kill
            her. And remember this, never forget this: when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk, you couldn't
            buy Brandy! Hear this now: I will always come for you. Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa... which
            I have.
        </p>

        <p>They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. Unless the
            enemy has studied his Agrippa... which I have. Move? You're alive. If you want I can fly. You just shook
            your head... doesn't that make you happy? Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. Probably he means no *harm*.
        </p>

        <p>You're the Dread Pirate Roberts, admit it. How may do you think you could handle? You mean you wish to
            surrender to me? Very well, I accept. But how can you be sure? Will this do? You truly love each other
            and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the
            story books say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will. As you know, the
            concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Really that's all this is except that instead of sucking
            water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five,
            but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this
            do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity so be honest. How do you feel? You only think I
            guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You
            fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war
            in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the
            line"! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...</p>
